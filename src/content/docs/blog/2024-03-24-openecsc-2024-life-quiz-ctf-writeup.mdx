## Getting an overview

Looking through the hosted web application, we get an overview of what Life Quiz is about. After registering an account
and logging in, we have three options:

1. Answer quiz questions. When we answer correctly, we get a point. After each attempt, we get a new question.
2. Request a prize. However, when we do that we are informed that we must first play the game.
3. Reset points. This resets our points and our current question.
