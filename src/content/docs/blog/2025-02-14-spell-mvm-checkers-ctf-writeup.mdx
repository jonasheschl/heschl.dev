Spell/MVM Checkers was a CTF challenge I wrote for the ECSC Vienna bootcamp 2024. The challenge was also
played at x3CTF feat. mvm 2025. At the end of x3CTF, the challenge had 24 solves.

To solve this challenge, players must first overwrite one of the default magic database files to configure a json
file to be detected as an image. After this, players must craft and upload a json file, read by a custom templating
engine to read the flag. Both these files must be specifically crafted polyglots to exploit parser differentials.

## Overwriting the mime database

To get the flag, players must upload a json file and pass it to `rebuild/index.php`. Players can furthermore upload new
magicians using `administration.php`. What stops players from uploading json files directly is a mime check in
`administration.php` enforcing the uploaded files to be jpeg. This check is performed using the `file` utility. PHP json
parsing is quite strict in what is allows as a json and will not parse files where data is appended or prepended.

When a magician is uploaded ".magic" is appended to the chosen magician name. The name is not sanitized however, so
players can add files ending in ".magic" to the system by naming a magician `../../../and/so/on`. One such file is
`/home/app/.magic`. The easiest way of finding that this path is checked for magic is by `strace`ing the `file` utility
- documentation on which files are checked is somewhat incomplete - like this: `strace --trace file file /etc/hosts`.

### magical polyglot #1

The magic itself can look like this:

```
0	string  {	jpeg
!:mime  image/jpeg
```

However, the magic must also pass the mime check for being an image when uploading magicians and be a valid magic file
(see man 5 file). Thus, a second polyglot must be constructed.

```
if (!preg_match('\w{1,5} image.*', $mime)) {
    echo "<p>Invalid upload!</p>";
    exit();
}
```

One such polyglot can be created using XBM images. XBM images are based solely on printable characters. Furthermore,
the XBM checks performed by `file` allow every line to be prefixed by a `#`. Since `#` is used by libmagic for comments,
the XBM image will not cause `file` to error out during mime checks.

### Overwriting the magic

With the polyglot constructed, players can upload the polyglot magic as a new magician with the name
`../../../../../home/app/`. This will overwrite `/home/app/.magic`.

## Uploading the template

This removes the first obstacle from uploading a custom template and exfiltrating the flag that way. However, due to an
undocumented behaviour, `file` will not apply the new magic to a standard json file. json and a few other file types
are implemented in a different way in magic and thus ignore the magic database. Before players can exfiltrate the flag,
they must construct another polyglot. This time a json file that can be parsed by PHP, while not being detected as json
by `file`.

```json
{"num": "\x56","sections":[{"type":"link","tag":"h1","value":"/flag.txt"}]}
```

One such polyglot can be constructed by adding special backslash characters to one of the json strings. This will result
in `file` not recognizing the file as json but will be stripped by the *sanitization* in PHP.

## Getting the flag

Finally, users render the custom template by navigating to `/rebuild.php?site=../magicians/NAME.json`.

# tl;dr

1. Navigate to `administration.php`.
2. Upload [magic.xbm](/2025-02-14-spell-mvm-checkers-ctf-writeup/magic.xbm) with the name `../../../../home/app/`.
3. Upload [exfil.json](/2025-02-14-spell-mvm-checkers-ctf-writeup/exfil.json) with the name `exfil`.
4. Navigate to `rebuild/?page=../magicians/exfil.magic`
