`Username Anarchy` is a tool used to generate a list of possible usernames from a persons real world name.

---

## Simple usage

The easiest way to use `Username Anarchy` is to provide it a first (and last) name. The tool will then output a list
of possible usernames for this person to `stdout`. You can of course easily redirect that output to a file if you wish
to use the usernames as input to another tool.

```shell
./username-anarchy Firstname Lastname
```

```shell
./username-anarchy Firstname Lastname > usernames.txt
```

## Advanced usage

`Username Anarchy` also supports providing further information, like username formatting, date of birth and much more.
A section covering these features will be added in the future.
