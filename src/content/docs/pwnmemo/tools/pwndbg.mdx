`pwndbg` is an extension for gdb, making debugging compiled applications a much nicer experience.

---

## Format letters

Many `pwndbg`/`gdb` commands support format letters. They indicate how to output (memory) values. When a command
supports the format letters, they usually have to be provided like so: `COMMAND/LETTER`. For example, `print/t $rax`
will output the contents of the `rax` register in binary.

The following format letters are supported:

- `o` (octal)
- `x` (hex)
- `d` (decimal)
- `u` (unsigned decimal),
- `t` (binary)
- `f` (float)
- `a` (address)
- `i` (instruction)
- `c` (char)
- `s` (string)
- `z` (hex, zero padded on the left).

## Setting register values

To change the values of registers, use `set` like so.

```
set $rdx = 0x5
```

`$rdx` can be replaced by any (sub)-register. For the value, hexadecimal (0x prefix), decimal (no prefix) and binary
(0b prefix) values are accepted. Prefix the value accordingly.

## Patching instructions at runtime

<Aside type="caution">
  `patch`'s second argument is currently always interpreted as assembly instructions and converted
  to machine code. This might change in the future. For now, when you want to patch using manually
  selected values, use `set` instead of `patch`.
</Aside>

`pwndbg` supports the `patch` command for patching program instructions at runtime. Simply run
`patch 0x1234 "instruction arg, arg"` to patch the instructions while running a binary. You can view all your currently
applied patches by running `patch_list`. To revert patches, run `patch_revert`.

## Patching strings at runtime

Unlike with `GEF`, `pwndbg`'s patch command does not support patching anything other than instructions. To patch a
string at runtime, use `set` instead. The syntax to patch a string looks like this:
`set *((char[<num chars>]) 0x1234) = "string here"`.

## Examining register values

<Aside type="caution">`x` will always try to dereference a register!</Aside>

Use `print` to output a registers value in a variety of formats. As with `x`, you can provide a format to `print`.

```
p /t $rax
```
