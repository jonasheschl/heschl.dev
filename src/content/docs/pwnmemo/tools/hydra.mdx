Hydra is a command line tool used to brute force credentials. Hydra supports a multitude of protocols and schemes.

## Simple usage

### GET Requests with HTTP basic auth

```shell
hydra -C /path/to/wordlist 1.2.3.4 -s 1337 -uf http-get /path
```

- `-C`: Singular, combined (`username:password`) wordlist to use.
- `1.2.3.4`: Target system.
- `-s`: Target port.
- `-u`: Iterate through users before passwords. E.g. Try all users on a password before trying the next password.
- `-f`: Stop searching for more valid credentials after finding the first valid.
- `http-get`: Try the credentials via HTTP basic auth.
- `/path`: The path to try the credentials on with HTTP basic auth.

### Separate username and password list

```shell
hydra -L /path/to/usernames -P /path/to/passwords -uf 1.2.3.4 -s 1337 <attack-method>
```

- `-L`: Wordlist to use for usernames.
- `-P`: Wordlist to use for passwords.
- `-u`: Iterate through users before passwords. E.g. Try all users on a password before trying the next password.
- `-f`: Stop searching for more valid credentials after finding the first valid.
- `1.2.3.4`: Target system.
- `-s`: Target port.
- `<attack-method>`: How hydra should try to use the credentials. For instance, HTTP basic auth.

### Known/static username or password

```shell
hydra -P /path/to/passwords -l "known-username" 1.2.3.4 -s 1337 -f <attack-method>
```

```shell
hydra -p "known-password" -L /path/to/usernames 1.2.3.4 -s 1337 -f <attack-method>
```

You can have either `-p` or `-l` lowercase, which makes hydra use it as a known, static credential. Uppercase on the
other hand will refer to the given wordlist for credentials.

- `-P`: Wordlist to use for passwords.
- `-p`: Known, static password.
- `-L`: Wordlist to use for usernames.
- `-l`: Known, static username.
- `1.2.3.4`: Target system.
- `-s`: Target port.
- `-f`: Stop searching for more valid credentials after finding the first valid.
- `http-get`: Try the credentials via HTTP basic auth.
- `/path`: The path to try the credentials on with HTTP basic auth.

### HTTP POST form encoded data

```shell
hydra -L /path/to/usernames -P /path/to/passwords 1.2.3.4 -s 1337 -uf http-post-form "/<path>:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=<failure-string>"
```

- `-L`: Wordlist to use for usernames.
- `-P`: Wordlist to use for passwords.
- `1.2.3.4`: Target system.
- `-s`: Target port.
- `-u`: Iterate through users before passwords. E.g. Try all users on a password before trying the next password.
- `-f`: Stop searching for more valid credentials after finding the first valid.
- `http-post-form`: Send a post request with the following form encoded data.
- `/path`: The path to try the credentials on with HTTP basic auth.
- `^USER^`: Where in the form encoded data to inject the username.
- `^PASS^`: Where in the form encoded data to inject the password.
- `<failure-string>`: A string which, when present in the response, indicates a login failure.

### SSH

```shell
hydra -L /path/to/usernames -P /path/to/passwords -uf ssh://1.2.3.4:1337 -t 4
```

- `-L`: Wordlist to use for usernames.
- `-P`: Wordlist to use for passwords.
- `-u`: Iterate through users before passwords. E.g. Try all users on a password before trying the next password.
- `-f`: Stop searching for more valid credentials after finding the first valid.
- `1.2.3.4`: Target system.
- `:1337`: Target port.
- `-t`: Reduce the number of threads to 4. SSH, by default, blocks more than 4 simultaneous connections.

### FTP

```shell
hydra -L /path/to/usernames -P /path/to/passwords -uf ftp://1.2.3.4
```

- `-L`: Wordlist to use for usernames.
- `-P`: Wordlist to use for passwords.
- `-u`: Iterate through users before passwords. E.g. Try all users on a password before trying the next password.
- `-f`: Stop searching for more valid credentials after finding the first valid.
- `1.2.3.4`: Target system.

## Saving progress

Hydra by default saves the current progress when aborting a scan. Using `hydra -R` the last run can be resumed from
where it was aborted.
