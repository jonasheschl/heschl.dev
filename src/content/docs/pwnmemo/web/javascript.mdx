## RegExp.prototype.test()

> The `test()` method of `RegExp` instances executes a search with this regular expression for a match between a regular
expression and a specified string. Returns `true` if there is a match; `false` otherwise.

â€“ From [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test).

When passed a non-string value, the given value will first be transformed to a string by its
[type-specific `ToString()` abstract operation](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-tostring).
Take this sample code for instance.

```js
/foo/.test(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);
```

The given array `["foo", "bar", "baz"]` will be transformed to a string like `"foo,bar,baz"`.
Thus, the above code is equivalent to `/foo/.test("foo,bar,baz");`. The `test()` call will thus return true. This works
for any type with a `ToString()` abstract operation.

See [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test)
and [the spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/text-processing.html#sec-regexp.prototype.test).
