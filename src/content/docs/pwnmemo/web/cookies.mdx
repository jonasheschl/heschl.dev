## Bypass SameSite=Strict with client side redirect

A cookie with `SameSite=Strict` set will not be sent on cross-site requests. Say a cookie with `SameSite=Strict` is set
on `https://example.com`. The user is currently viewing `https://example2.com`. They now trigger a request to
`https://example.com` (for example, by clicking a link, form or JavaScript fetch). The cookie will not be sent! This
can prevent CSRF attacks.

One way of bypassing this security mechanism is to exploit client side redirects. A navigation triggered on the target
site, to the target site will result in the `SameSite=Strict` cookie being reintroduced to the cookie jar.

```url
https://example.com?redirect=https://example.com
```

Doing a `window.open()` with the above URL will result in the `SameSite=Strict` cookie being sent on the second request
(after the redirect).
