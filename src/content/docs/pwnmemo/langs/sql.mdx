## SQL without spaces

One simple way to run arbitrary SQL without spaces is to use tabs (`\t`) instead. If that is not possible, most DMSes
still allow arbitrary SQL by using a combination of braces (`()`) and identifier separators/backticks (``` ` ```).

Tabs, newlines or braces

## SQL queries/injections without knowing column names

Make a subquery and select the columns from there with `as`.
