## /proc/X/root symlink

Every process subdirectory of `/proc` contains a file `root` pointing to the filesystem root. For instance
`/proc/1/root` will point to `/`. This also works with `/proc/self/root`. This symlink can be used to bypass filters
and blacklists for LFI. A path to read `/etc/hosts` might look like this: `/proc/self/root/etc/hosts`.
