This repository contains the source code for my website heschl.dev which includes a
blog as well as a hack-tricks-esque reference named pwnmemo.

## Blog post ideas

1. How to set up screencapture with python using OBS. Exisiting articles periodcaly
take screenshots, wich is of course less than optimal and not a possibility for many
use cases.
2. Adding expressive code plugins to starlight.

## Pwnmemo article ideas

1. Reference cheatsheets for ffuf, nmap and possible others.
 1. For ffuf also mention integration with burp suite as per https://becomingahacker.org/a-quick-guide-to-using-ffuf-with-burp-suite-713492f62242
2. Content sniffing and how to exploit it
3. Bypassing PHP image verifications when only image type and length are checked
using scuffed C-code image format (GlacierCTF web challenge).
